# Taylor

iOS Framework with a bunch of classes and helpers for Swift. 

## Installation

You will need [Carthage](github.com/carthage/carthage) to use Taylor in your project.

	1. Create a `Cartfile`
	2. Add `github "mirego/taylor-ios" "master"`
	3. Run `carthage bootstrap --platform ios --use-ssh`
	4. Drop the generated `Taylor.framework` into your project

:warning: Don't forget to add the "Copy framework" build phase, as explained in [the official documentation](https://github.com/carthage/carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos).

## What about Jenkins?

Carthage is installed on all of our Jenkins slaves. Add the following to your build script:
	
```shell
BUILD_PREBUILD_SCRIPT="carthage_bootstrap.sh"
```

In "carthage_bootstrap.sh":
	
```shell
carthage bootstrap --platform ios --use-ssh
```
