# Taylor

iOS Framework with a bunch of classes and helpers for Swift.

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+, tvOS 9.0+
- Xcode 9.4
- Swift 4 (use the `v1.1` tag if you need Swift < 2.3 support)

## Installation

You can use [Carthage](//github.com/carthage/carthage) to install `Taylor` by adding it to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "mirego/taylor-ios"
```

### CocoaPods
You can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install `Taylor` by adding it to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'MRGTaylor'
```

### Manually

1. Download and drop the Swift file you need in your project.  
2. Congratulations!

## Usage example

```swift
import Taylor

let button = UIButton(type: .Custom)
button.setBorder(width: 2, color: .redColor())
```

## Safe area insets

Taylor provides a backward compatible version of `safeAreaInsets` property for UIView. The original API is available on iOS 11 and above and the replacement fills the gap on older OS version (iOS 7 to 10 inclusively). It is an opt-in feature that requires to be enabled in order to work.

To enable the feature, place this piece of code the earliest possible in your AppDelegate's `application:didFinishLaunching:withOptions` method:
```swift
UIViewController.enableCompatibilitySafeAreaInsets()
```

Your can now access the `compatibilitySafeAreaInsets` property from any UIView. On iOS 11 and above, this property returns `safeAreaInsets`. To receive safe area update callbacks, your view must conform to the `CompatibilitySafeAreaInsetsUpdate` protocol.

To cover every iOS versions, your subview could look like this:
```swift
class BaseView: UIView, CompatibilitySafeAreaInsetsUpdate {
    func compatibilitySafeAreaInsetsDidChange() {
        commonSafeAreaInsetsDidChange()
    }

    @available(iOS 11.0, *)
    override func safeAreaInsetsDidChange() {
        super.safeAreaInsetsDidChange()
        commonSafeAreaInsetsDidChange()
    }

    func commonSafeAreaInsetsDidChange() {
        setNeedsLayout()
    }
}
```

## Bonus

* There is a `no-bitcode` branch that's (hopefully) kept up to date with the master.
